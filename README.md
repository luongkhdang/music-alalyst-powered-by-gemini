## The Secret Sauce

- **5-Step Analysis**: Your track gets the VIP treatment through a multi-step analysis
  - 🎹 **Step 1**: Musical foundation & hook hunting
  - 🎚️ **Step 2**: Sound engineering detective work
  - 🎵 **Step 3**: Harmony & melody exploration
  - 🏗️ **Step 4**: Structure optimization
  - 🔍 **Step 5**: Critical evaluation by your harshest producer friend
- **Refinement**: An extremely critical musical specialist with decades of experience tears it all apart (in a good way!)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone, install, set up .env with your API keys
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
# Let the magic happen
from src.gemini.gemini_client import GeminiClient
from src.gemini.gemini_hooks.audio_to_image_processor import AudioToImageProcessor

client = GeminiClient()
processor = AudioToImageProcessor(client=client)

# One line to rule them all
result = processor.process_audio_file("your_next_hit.mp3")
```

## Pro Tips

- Each analysis step listens to your track 6 times (that's 30+ listens total!)

## Synthwave Viral Blueprint: Project "Neon Drive" (2025)

**Project Goal:** Elevate "Neon Drive" to viral status in 2025 by optimizing its sonic signature, emotional impact, and platform fit.

**1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS:**

- **Genre:** Melancholic Synthwave with Retrowave and Melodic Techno influences.
- **Tempo:** 124.9 BPM.
- **Key:** G Minor.
- **Standout Instrumentation:** Sawtooth lead synth (fundamental around 440 Hz), driving sub-bass, arpeggiated synth. The lead synth incorporates chorus and delay effects. The sub-bass has subtle distortion and harmonic content.
- **Viral Sonic Signature:** Gated reverb, sidechained bass, and a punchy kick. Sidechaining is subtle. Gated reverb is primarily used on the snare and some synth elements.
- **Essential Engineering:** Precise EQ carving to prevent muddiness (especially in the bridge, 1:00-1:15), wide stereo imaging for synths. Example: High-pass filter pad synth around 300Hz.

**2. EMOTIONAL QUALITIES:**

- **Mood:** Nostalgic, melancholic, driving, longing.
- **Energy:** Builds from subtle anticipation to high-energy drive, with moments of respite.
- **Emotional Arc:** Introverted reflection -> Energetic release -> Harmonically rich contemplation -> Intensified drive -> Gradual fade into memory. The "harmonically rich contemplation" section (around 1:00) shifts to a more melodic and less rhythmically intense section, creating contrast.
- **Viral Hooks:** Catchy arpeggiated intro (0:00-0:15), memorable lead synth melody (0:15-0:30), and a variation with added effects (0:45-1:00).

**3. VISUAL ASSOCIATIONS:**

- **Colors:** Neon blues, purples, and pinks against a dark, gridded cityscape.
- **Scenes:** Retro arcade, chrome sports car speeding down a rain-slicked highway, digital sunsets, glitching computer screens.
- **Imagery:** 8-bit graphics, geometric patterns, synthwave album art, cyberpunk aesthetics.
- **Viral Visual Potential:** Looping animations synced to the beat, glitch art transitions, retro-futuristic landscapes, and kinetic typography.

**4. CREATIVE DIRECTION:**

**Viral Hook Optimization:**

1.  **Vocal Chop Layer:** Add a subtle, pitched-up vocal chop sample to the main theme (0:15-0:30) for ear candy. Requires careful execution.
2.  **Rhythmic Stutter:** Introduce a 1/16th note stutter effect on the last note of every 4-bar phrase in the main theme. Needs careful implementation to avoid sounding gimmicky.
3.  **Harmonic Depth:** Insert a Cm chord at 1:07 to add harmonic interest and dynamism.
4.  **Intro/Outro Trim:** Shorten the intro and outro to 8 seconds (4 bars) each for immediate impact and satisfying closure.
5.  **Bridge Clarity:** Apply high-pass filter to pad synth around 300 Hz and subtle sidechain compression to the kick drum.
6.  **AI Vocal Texture:** Layer a short, ethereal AI-generated vocal phrase in the variation section (0:45-1:00). Requires careful selection and processing.

**Platform Fit:**

- **TikTok/Reels:** Optimize for 10-15 second loopable segments (e.g., 0:15-0:30, 0:45-1:00).
- **Streaming:** Master for -10 LUFS, ensuring dynamic range and punch.

**Reference Artists:** Perturbator, Kavinsky, The Midnight, Gunship (with a touch of Daft Punk's production polish).

**Streamlined Improvement Roadmap:**

1.  **Enhance Hook Strength:** Layer vocal chops, rhythmic edits, and EQ adjustments.
2.  **Address Engineering Flaws:** Improve bridge clarity with filtering and sidechaining.
3.  **Increase Harmonic/Melodic Impact:** Add chord insertions and AI vocal textures.
4.  **Optimize Structure:** Trim intro/outro and enhance transitions.
5.  **Experiment with Bold Enhancements:** Incorporate subtle global percussion and bit-crushing.
