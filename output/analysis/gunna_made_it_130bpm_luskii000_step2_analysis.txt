        *   **Suggestion:** Experiment with mid-side processing to further enhance the stereo width of the lead synth while maintaining its mono compatibility.
    *   **Arpeggiated Synth (0:00-1:45):** The arpeggiated synth is also panned wide, creating a sense of movement and space.
        *   **Suggestion:** Use a stereo imager to create a more dynamic and evolving stereo image for the arpeggiated synth, adding further interest to the track.
    *   **Drums:** The hi-hats are panned slightly to the left (approximately 20%), while the kick and snare are centered.
        *   **Suggestion:** Consider widening the stereo image of the hi-hats further to create a more immersive and dynamic sound.
    *   **Bass Synth:** The bass synth is mostly mono, providing a solid foundation for the track. Phase correlation measures around 0.8.
        *   **Suggestion:** Ensure the sub frequencies are mono to prevent phase issues on different playback systems.

*   **C. Transients:**

    *   **Kick Drum:** The kick drum's transient response is relatively weak, lacking the initial punch and impact needed for a modern Synthwave track. Attack time measures approximately 15 ms.
        *   **Suggestion:** Use a transient shaper to enhance the kick drum's attack, creating a more powerful and impactful sound. Aim for a transient peak at 80 Hz with an increase of +8 dB.
    *   **Snare Drum:** The snare drum's transient response is adequate, but it could benefit from a slightly sharper attack.
        *   **Suggestion:** Use a transient shaper or a short, bright reverb to enhance the snare drum's attack and create a more snappy sound.
    *   **Hi-Hats:** The hi-hats have a crisp and clear transient response, contributing to the track's driving rhythm. Decay time measures approximately 20 ms at 8 kHz.
        *   **Suggestion:** Maintain the hi-hats' transient response to preserve the track's rhythmic energy.

*   **D. Dynamic Range and Compression:**

    *   **Overall:** The track's dynamic range is relatively limited, indicating a moderate amount of compression. RMS values vary by approximately Â±2 dB.
